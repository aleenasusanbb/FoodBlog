        "recepie":"This easy (one-bowl!) Eggless Chocolate Cake is a simple vegan recipe you’re sure to come back to time and again. Unbelievably soft and light, you won’t believe that this decadent, chocolatey sponge cake is actually made with healthy whole wheat flour. Make this Chocolate Cake today (with or without frosting) following my video and detailed recipe with stepwise photos.Cocoa Powder: The most important ingredient contributing to the flavor of the eggless chocolate cake is cocoa powder. It is important to use a good quality, naturally processed cocoa powder as this will affect the overall taste and consistency of the cake. Do not use dutch-process cocoa powder, or you might end up with a dense, stodgy result.Whole Wheat Flour: This vegan chocolate cake is incredibly light and soft. If you were only to judge the cake based on texture, you would never guess that it was made with whole wheat flour.That said, the choice of healthy whole wheat flour will provide an almost nutty flavor in the cake. This recipe has been tried and tested with the Indian wheat flour (used to make roti) and the wheat flour available in USA and Europe. Use any good quality whole wheat flour. You can also opt to substitute all-purpose flour instead.Sweeteners: For the sweeteners, you can opt to use raw sugar (like I have done) or swap in white sugar or brown sugar. You can also add jaggery, maple syrup, coconut sugar or palm sugar instead but the taste of the cake will be different. Avoid adding honey. According to Ayurveda, honey should not be heated as it becomes toxic.",

        "recepie":"Whole Wheat Flour  – I prefer to use whole wheat flour (atta) in my bakes to add an extra boost of nutrition. If you don’t have any on hand, you can easily swap in all-purpose flour (maida) or bread flour instead.Sugar – Feel free to use unrefined cane sugar, powdered jaggery, or regular sugar.Oranges – Fresh citrus not only tastes better, but it also has the added benefit of a secret ingredient: zest! Be sure to only remove the orange colored zest as the white pith is quite bitter. Also, word to the wise — zest before you cut and juice the oranges. For purchasing knowledge, I got 1 cup of orange juice from 3 medium oranges.Baking Soda & Baking Powder – Yes, you need both. No, they cannot be used interchangeably. Also, please note that baking powder begins to react as soon as it is added to liquid, so you’ll want to make sure you preheat the oven before you make the batter lest you miss out on some of the rising power.",

I had used the Indian variety of alphonso mangoes that were sweet. If in case your mangoes are not sweet, then add some sugar.f you have access to alphonso mangoes, include them.

Choose to make any Gulab Jamun Recipe depending on the ingredients you have.Gulab Jamun is a very popular Indian sweet made from deep fried balls of milk based dough that are soaked in sugary syrup. It is a favorite dessert of ours, and we often serve it for weddings, birthdays, festivals, parties or even as a post-prandial treat.Gulab jamun can literally be translated to “rose berries,” and are so named because the sugar syrup is scented with rose water and the fried dough balls are a similar size to a dark purple berry known as black plum or java plum.Then add ¾ cup (100 grams) grated paneer, 2 tablespoons fine rava (semolina), 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, ¼ teaspoon baking powder and ½ teaspoon cardamom powder to the mashed khoya.This gulab jamun recipe made with milk powder is a cheat’s version but tastes equally good.

Basically this sweet is a semolina pudding which is flavored with saffron and has an orange color. Rava kesari has an orange color. Generally synthetic orange food color is added while making kesari. Since I don’t use any synthetic colors in food, I have used saffron and a natural orange color extract to give orange color. But note that the addition of only saffron will give yellow tones and not orange.",

Next time, when you get your hands on this fresh produce during its season, go for this sweet. I’m not saying that don’t make the Carrot Halwa. All I’m saying is that this Carrot Burfi is also a way of having those similar halwa flavors in a mithai (sweet) form. Plus, it lets you portion control too as you know you’re going to have a piece of it, and not over-fill a bowl, as it happens in case of the halwa!After the Carrot Burfi is set properly, you can cut it in any shape that you like – square, rectangle, diamond, etc. – and serve. Along with this burfi made with a veggie, there are many other versions of this mithai that are available across the Indian subcontinent. Some are even fancy and very modern-day like. For instance, burfis made with chocolate, rose, mango, etc.The recipe of carrot barfi is similar to the way gajar halwa is made. Here I have used milk powder in the burfi. So obviously the recipe does not have milk or condensed milk or khoya.Red Delhi carrots are in season now and time to make various carrot based recipes like carrot halwa, Gajar ka murabba. Every year I make gajar halwa with the tender juicy carrots we get in winter.The flavoring is done by the cardamom powder and pistachios that compliment the overall flavor of this gajar ka halwaish burfi.",
