         "recepie":"Pani puri is an immensely popular Indian street food of crispy, hollow, fried dough balls (puri) stuffed with boiled potatoes or steamed moong sprouts or boiled chickpeas or white peas curry (also known as ragda) together with spicy tangy water and a sweet chutney. Pani puri is a favorite chaat snack of many folks and ours too. With so many bursts of tastes and flavors in your mouth when you have pani puri, you just cannot have one.This sweet chutney is called as Meetha (which means sweet) Pani. The spicy water is called as Teekha (which means spicy) Pani. Both are added in the puri along with the main filling which consists of boiled potatoes, cooked chickpeas, moong sprouts or a thick dry curry made from white peas which is called as Ragda.This pani or spiced water recipe is my mom’s recipe and to save time she would make the pani in such a way that it would have all the three major tastes – spicy, tangy and sweet. So all three tastes – teekha, khatta and meetha taste in just one pani. Otherwise generally both the spicy chutney and sweet chutney are made separately.Pani puri is my most favorite chaat from childhood. I used to have them often with my family on the streets of Mumbai (Bombay) and it was something I have thoroughly enjoyed.",

        "recepie":"Paneer Tikka is a popular and delicious tandoori snack where Paneer (Indian cottage cheese cubes) are marinated in a spiced yogurt-based marinade, arranged on skewers and grilled in the oven. Worry not if you don’t have an oven – instead of grilling in oven, you can make Paneer Tikka Recipe on stovetop on a tawa/skillet. In this post I am sharing both the oven and stoveto.The Indian spice powders mixed with the yogurt (curd) make a flavorful marinade that is soaked up by the porous paneer cubes. Grilling the skewers then produces a nice slightly crispiness on the paneer.!Paneer (Indian Cottage Cheese): This is the main ingredient in the dish and it is important to use a good quality paneer. In fact, as with all my paneer recipes, I recommend using Homemade Paneer. This ensures freshness and avoids any hidden ingredients and preservatives found in store-bought paneer.Marinade: Homeade Hung Curd (Hung Yogurt) is used as the base of the marinade. You can even use Greek Yogurt. The ground spices are then added to balance out the sour yogurt taste and give a flavor kick to the dish.Veggies: Here I have used bell peppers (capsicum) and onions. You can use veggies of your choice, including baby corn, mushrooms, cauliflower, tomatoes, broccoli and more.A typical vada can be made using lentils or legumes, vegetables, sago or a combination of all, along with veggies, seasonings, spices and herbs that are added to enhance the taste, texture and nutritive value. Some vada versions include Dahi Vada, Sabudana Vada, Maddur Vada and more.",

        "recepie":"This Burger Recipe covers everything needed to make delightful veggie burgers from scratch, including how to prepare and pan fry delicious homemade vegetable patties. And because no veggie burger is complete without its own special sauce, I have included instruction on how to make the perfect tangy, sweet and spicy mayonnaise dressing.So you won’t get a chewiness or a meat like texture in my burger recipe. Instead you will be surprised to find crispy flavorful moist patties sandwiched between soft toasted buns with vibrant freshness from sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, onion and a bright mayo dressing – making for the perfect veggie burger experience. Mixed Vegetables: Steamed potatoes, carrots, French beans and green peas make up the bulk of the patty. Garlic, ginger and green chilies (hot peppers) are sautéed and then added to the patty mix for an amazing flavor.Spices: I use Indian spices in this burger recipe to flavor the patties, including coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala powder, red chili powder or cayenne pepper and turmeric powder. These spices combine for a very flavorful patty. You can play around with the combination of these spices and also add your choice of herbs and spices. Burger Buns: I used fresh whole wheat burger buns that I got from a local bakery. You can also make homemade burger buns, if you prefer. Since it takes time to make the veggie burger patty itself, I recommend making the buns in advance.Spiced Mayonnaise Dressing: I used an eggless mayonnaise as the base for the dressing in this burger recipe. For a vegan burger use vegan mayonnaise. Spices, lemon juice, vinegar, oil and a bit of sugar is added to the mayonnaise for a custom dressing that complements the veggie burger perfectly.",

        "recepie":"Frying: You have a few options when it comes to frying the cauliflower florets. Once they have been dipped in batter pan fry, shallow fry or deep fry the florets. Pan frying is a terrific option for anyone who wants to cut down on fat. Shallow frying will require slightly more oil and deep frying will make super crispy florets with a high fat content. It really is up to you!Soy sauce: Don’t skip the soy sauce as it adds a delicious umami flavor to this dish. Go for good quality soy sauce for this recipe the best results. I like to use naturally fermented soy sauce because it tastes amazing but if you are not a fan of soy sauce then swap it for Bragg Liquid Aminos or tamari instead.Oil: To make the perfect crispy gobi manchurian make sure the oil is hot. If the oil is not hot enough then the florets won’t be crispy and will absorb more oil. To test the oil add one cauliflower floret covered in batter in the pan and fry it on both sides until golden. If the florets crisp up then the oil is hot enough.Batter: Make sure that the batter is the right consistency for this recipe. It should be silky smooth and have a medium consistency. Not too thick and not too thin. If you fry florets in a thick batter then the florets will not crisp up and if the batter is too thin then the florets will become too crispy.Street food style gobi manchurian: I prefer to make dry gobi manchurian without MSG or Ajinomoto but, if you want street food style gobi then add a pinch of either ingredient to it.",

Masala Corn can be that ultimate dish that you can munch on, without any guilt, as an evening snack or pair as a side dish with your lunch and dinner meals.

You have the Masala Corn Recipe that can become a favorite of one and all, in the very first bite!For the Masala Corn Recipe, the corn should ideally be hot or warm. It should not be at room temperature or cold. So, when I make it, I steam the corn on cobs in the pressure cooker and while they are still lightly hot or warm , remove the kernels from it. Then, put it in a bowl, mix with all the spices, herbs and seasonings, and serve immediately.This Masala Corn is not a specific recipe as such, but just how I go about in making it. You can always add your choice of less or more ingredients in it and come up with even more unique and tasty variations.",

This sweet snack is a popular one in the scenic state of Kerala in South India. This Unniyappam Recipe is quite a nutritious preparation, and is gluten free as well as vegan-friendly too.When I make unniyappam I prefer to use raw rice. With rice flour the appams have a dense texture at times. It could be due to the organic rice flour I use. So I stopped making unniyappam with rice flour and started making them with raw rice. There is a noticeable difference in texture as well as taste when using raw rice.I choose a simple method and grind everything in the mixie. Thereby saving time and effort. Of course, you do need to soak rice for a couple of hours. Then later grind everything and prepare the unniyappam with the batter.You can even deep fry the unniyappam if you do not have an appe chaati. If offering as naivdeyam, then you can add a pinch of edible camphor in the batter",
